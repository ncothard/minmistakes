I am a [NASA Postdoctoral Program Fellow](https://npp.orau.org/) at [Goddard Space Flight Center](https://www.nasa.gov/goddard). I develop novel superconducting detectors and cryogenic optics for far-infrared and sub-millimeter orbital and sub-orbital telescopes, with the goal of enabling observations of galaxy evolution over cosmic time. I work with on range of technologies including silicon substrate frequency selective surfaces, kinetic inductance detectors, frequency-multiplexed radio-frequency readout, cryogenic & vacuum systems, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. With teams of engineers and scientists at NASA Goddard and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, I integrate these technologies to construct the next generation space-based observatories. To learn more about my time at Goddard, check out my [Early Career Scientist Spotlight article](https://science.gsfc.nasa.gov/600/ECSS/Nicholas-Cothard.html).

As an applied physicist, I enjoy bridging the gap between state-of-the-art light-sensing technologies and our understanding of the universe. The goal of my work is to develop, improve, and deploy these technologies for new astrophysics observatories. Once launched, these technologies will enable studies of the content and evolution of the the most sensitive and precise measurements of the cosmic microwave background and regions of early star-forming galaxies.


Previously, I was a graduate student in Applied and Engineering Physics at Cornell University. As a graduate NASA Space Technology Research Fellow, my research focused primarily on millimeter-wave optics and superconducting detectors for ground-based Cosmic Microwave Background and Epoch of Reionization observatories. I worked with Professors [Michael Niemack](https://www.classe.cornell.edu/~mdn49/index.html) and [Gordon Stacey](https://astro.cornell.edu/gordon-j-stacey) as part of the [CCAT-prime](http://www.ccatobservatory.org/), [Simons Observatory](https://simonsobservatory.org/), [Advanced ACTPol](https://act.princeton.edu/), and [CMB Stage-4](https://cmb-s4.org/) collaborations.

#I work at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, developing novel superconducting detectors and cryogenic optics for far-infrared and submillimeter telescopes. My research experience involves transition edge sensors, kinetic inductance detectors, time-domain and frequency-domain cryogenic readout, and silicon-based frequency selective surfaces. 

#Dr. Cothard is a NASA Postdoctoral Program Fellow at Goddard Space Flight Center. He works on cryogenic optics and superconducting detectors for far-infrared and sub-millimeter telescope instrumentation. The goal of his technology development is to enable observations of the early universe and build a more complete picture of galaxy evolution over cosmic time.
