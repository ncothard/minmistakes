Welcome! I'm a PhD candidate in Applied and Engineering Physics and a NASA Space Technology Research Fellow at Cornell University. I work with Professors [Michael Niemack](https://www.classe.cornell.edu/~mdn49/index.html) and [Gordon Stacey](https://astro.cornell.edu/gordon-j-stacey) as part of the [CCAT-prime](http://www.ccatobservatory.org/), [Simons Observatory](https://simonsobservatory.org/), and [Advanced ACTPol](https://act.princeton.edu/) collaborations. My research currently focuses on far-IR and millimeter optics, superconducting detectors, and cryogenic readout systems for telescope instrumentation.

As an applied physicist, I enjoy bridging the gap between state-of-the-art light-sensing technologies and our understanding of the early universe. The goal of my PhD is to develop, improve, and deploy these technoliges for cosmology and astrophysics observatories, enabling the most sensitive and precise measurements of the cosmic microwave background and regions of early star-forming galaxies.
